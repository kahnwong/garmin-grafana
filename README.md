# garmin-grafana

Based on <https://github.com/arpanghosh8453/garmin-grafana> but I stitched all the configs so you don't need to do it manually.

Copy .env.example and set garmin username & password. If you can't authenticate verify that your base64 password does NOT include trailing space / new line character.

## Usage

```bash
make start
```
